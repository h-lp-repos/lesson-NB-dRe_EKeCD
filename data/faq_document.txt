There are no additional equipment provisions beyond standard-approved devices, and the policy is reviewed annually.

Q: How can I request leave?
A: Employees can request leave through the HR portal by selecting the leave type, dates, and providing a reason. Manager approval is required, and HR will send a confirmation email once the leave is approved. Leave balances are updated automatically, and employees can view their remaining days in the portal. Emergency leave requests should be communicated directly to HR and the manager.

Q: What is the process for travel reimbursement?
A: To request travel reimbursement, employees must submit itemized receipts through the expense management system within 30 days of travel completion.

Reimbursements are typically processed within ten business days after final approval.

Q: Where can I find the code of conduct?

It covers professional behavior, anti-harassment guidelines, conflict of interest policies, and disciplinary procedures. Employees are required to review and acknowledge the code of conduct annually through the compliance training portal.

Q: What security protocols should I follow?

Sensitive data must be stored on encrypted drives, and file sharing should occur only through approved secure channels. Any security incidents must be reported immediately to the IT security team via the incident response system.

Q: How do I generate reports in the dashboard?
A: The platform dashboard includes a report builder where users can select metrics, filters, and visualization types.

Users must have appropriate access permissions to view financial or confidential data.

Role changes take effect immediately. For temporary elevated access, employees should submit a request form specifying the duration and justification.

Q: How does the onboarding process work?
A: New hires receive an onboarding packet via email, including account setup instructions, access credentials, and training schedules.

Q: What is the offboarding procedure?
A: When an employee exits the organization, managers submit an offboarding request in the HR portal, triggering account deactivation, access revocation, and exit interview scheduling. IT collects company assets, and HR processes final compensation. All offboarding steps are audited to ensure security and compliance.
